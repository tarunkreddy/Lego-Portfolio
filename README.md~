# Lego-Portfolio

Goals are listed below.

1. Quickly retrieve 6 month bricklink average prices for multiple lego sets quickly.
2. Add Lego sets to a portfolio which tracks an estimated sale price using bricklink average, as well as allowing input of purchase price, any promotions/cashback (VIP points, ebay bucks), and actual sale price. 
3. Search /r/lego_raffles and /r/legomarket for product IDs, and retrieve the number of completed raffles/sales for that product. Use this information as part of a score for desirability on the market in addition to number of bricklink sales in last 6 months, possibly could include other factors into this. 
4. Check Brickset for lowest retail prices
